However, if you were to inject malicious code within that `<b>` tag, it could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities or other issues on a website.\n\nFor instance, an attacker might inject JavaScript code within the `<b>` tag to execute malicious scripts on the user's browser. This is why web applications often employ measures like input validation and sanitization to prevent such attacks.\n\nHere's how you can modify your example to include some basic HTML injection:\n\n```html\n<b>Hello World!</b>\n```\n\nThis will display \"Hello World!\" in bold font, but it's essential for developers to be aware of the potential risks associated with user-inputted content.", "ok": true, "error": null, "latency_ms": 6239, "status": 200, "endpoint": "chat"}
